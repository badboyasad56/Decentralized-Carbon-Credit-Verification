# Decentralized Carbon Credit Verification System

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform revolutionizes the carbon credit market by providing transparent, immutable verification of carbon reduction initiatives. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, the system ensures the integrity of carbon credits from project registration through ongoing monitoring to final certification. This creates a trustworthy marketplace that accelerates climate action by connecting project developers, verifiers, and credit purchasers in a seamless ecosystem.

## Core Components

The platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Project Registration Contract**
    - Records details of carbon reduction initiatives
    - Stores project metadata including location, methodology, and expected impact
    - Manages project ownership and development rights
    - Implements standardized project categorization
    - Maintains historical record of project modifications
    - Provides transparent project discovery mechanism

2. **Methodology Verification Contract**
    - Validates calculation approaches for carbon reduction
    - Implements governance for methodology approval
    - Stores detailed methodology documentation and algorithms
    - Maps methodologies to appropriate project types
    - Manages methodology versions and updates
    - Ensures scientific rigor in carbon accounting

3. **Monitoring Contract**
    - Tracks ongoing performance of carbon projects
    - Records verifiable data from IoT devices and manual reporting
    - Implements time-bound monitoring schedules
    - Compares actual versus projected performance
    - Flags anomalies for verification review
    - Maintains complete audit trail of monitoring activities

4. **Certification Contract**
    - Issues verified carbon reduction credits
    - Implements multi-signature approval workflows
    - Mints non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing carbon credits
    - Manages credit retirement and usage tracking
    - Prevents double-counting across registries
    - Facilitates transparent credit trading

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on:

- ChainLink oracles for secure external data feeds
- Zero-knowledge proofs for selective disclosure of sensitive data
- Layer 2 scaling solution for reduced transaction costs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- Hardhat development environment
- MetaMask or compatible Ethereum wallet
- IPFS node (optional for local development)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Carbon Project

```javascript
const ProjectRegistry = artifacts.require("ProjectRegistry");

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const registry = await ProjectRegistry.deployed();
  
  await registry.registerProject(
    "Amazon Reforestation Initiative",
    "Restoration of 5,000 hectares of degraded land in the Brazilian Amazon",
    "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", // Project developer address
    "Brazil",
    "Forestry",
    "AR-ACM0003", // Methodology ID
    50000, // Expected annual carbon reduction in tonnes CO2e
    2030, // Project end year
    "ipfs://QmW2WQi7j6c7UgJTarActp7tDNikE4B2qXtFCfLPdsgaTQ" // IPFS hash for project documentation
  );
  
  console.log("Project registered successfully");
  callback();
};
```

### Validating a Methodology

```javascript
const MethodologyVerification = artifacts.require("MethodologyVerification");

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const methodology = await MethodologyVerification.deployed();
  
  await methodology.registerMethodology(
    "AR-ACM0003",
    "Afforestation and Reforestation of Lands Except Wetlands",
    "UNFCCC",
    "Forestry",
    1714521600, // Unix timestamp for registration date: April 30, 2024
    "ipfs://QmT9qk3CRYbFDWpDFYeAv8T8n1nTHHUFDRMr5Nh6mZCyGn" // IPFS hash for methodology documentation
  );
  
  console.log("Methodology registered successfully");
  callback();
};
```

### Recording Monitoring Data

```javascript
const MonitoringContract = artifacts.require("MonitoringContract");

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const monitoring = await MonitoringContract.deployed();
  
  const projectId = 1; // ID from project registration
  const monitoringPeriod = "2024-Q2";
  const timestamp = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000);
  
  await monitoring.submitMonitoringData(
    projectId,
    monitoringPeriod,
    timestamp,
    12500, // Quarterly carbon reduction in tonnes CO2e
    "ipfs://QmUNLLsPACCz1vLxQVkXqqLX5R1X345qqfHbsf67hvA3Nn" // IPFS hash for monitoring evidence
  );
  
  console.log("Monitoring data submitted successfully");
  callback();
};
```

### Issuing Carbon Credits

```javascript
const CertificationContract = artifacts.require("CertificationContract");

module.exports = async function(callback) {
  const certification = await CertificationContract.deployed();
  
  const projectId = 1; // ID from project registration
  const verifierAddress = "0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12";
  
  await certification.issueCarbonCredits(
    projectId,
    12500, // Verified carbon reduction in tonnes CO2e
    "2024-Q2", // Credit vintage
    verifierAddress,
    "ipfs://QmVcSqVEsim4Jz8SrUTQKhxKz8TdGYpCVrHx7uXLde4GCW" // IPFS hash for verification report
  );
  
  console.log("Carbon credits issued successfully");
  callback();
};
```
